Project development was done in Mac OS and Windows, and therefore are the recommended development platforms for this project.

Unity currently does not have an official Unity3D build for Linux systems. Though there is currently an `unofficial build <https://forum.unity.com/threads/unity-on-linux-release-notes-and-known-issues.350256/>`_, it is untested and therefore unsupported by this project.

Downloading the project
***************************

To download a copy of the latest ``master`` branch in ``git`` you can clone the repository:

.. code-block:: bash

  git clone --recursive https://github.com/muramasa2402/DroNeSProject
