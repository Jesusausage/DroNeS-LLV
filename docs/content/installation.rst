The project development was done in Mac OS and Windows and are therefore the recommended development platforms for this project.

Unity currently does not have an official Unity3D build for Linux systems. There is currently an `unofficial build <https://forum.unity.com/threads/unity-on-linux-release-notes-and-known-issues.350256/>`_ but it is untested and therefore unsupported by this project.
