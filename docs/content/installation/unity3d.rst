  1. Download and install Unity Hub following the `official instructions <https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/GettingStartedInstallingHub.html>`_
  2. The Unity version used for this project is **Unity 2018.3.0f2**, and is what you will need to use to build the project
  3. Download and install the correct version (Unity 2018.3.0) from the `Unity archives page <https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive>`_

Once completed, install the rest of the dependencies or proceed to build instructions.
