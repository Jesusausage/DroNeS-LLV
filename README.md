# DroNeS: Drone Network Simulator

DroNeS is a graphical simulation software that aims to let end-users test and benchmark the performances of different routing and scheduling algorithms in a large scale drone network.

## Build and Install

Instructions on how to install and build the software can be found in the [DroNeS documentation](https://drones.readthedocs.io/)

### External Servers

The simulation requires external routing and job scheduling servers to control the simulated drones.

An example demo of these servers are provided in the [DroNeS-Servers](https://github.com/chowder/DroNeS-Servers) repository. Further instructions on how to run or customise these servers can be found in their respective documentation.
