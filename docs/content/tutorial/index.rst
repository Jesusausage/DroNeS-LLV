External Servers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default minimum-working examples for the external routing and job scheduling servers required by DroNeS are provided.

Instructions on how to install, configure and run these servers can be found in the `DroNeS-Servers documentation <https://drones-servers.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

DroNeS
^^^^^^

  1. Launch the `city_v1.exe` file, selecting appropriate display options.
  2. At the start screen, head to the settings page to configure the endpoints of the external servers being used. When connected properly, the indicators on the left of the fields should turn green.
  3. Head back to the menu and click on **Start**

A simulation should launch shortly within a minute. Drones and hubs may be added using the controls at the bottom left of the screen.
